Python Candidate Test Instructions
This test is meant to help you as a candidate to demonstrate your skills as a Python developer.
Instead of asking traditional algorithmic questions we are going to focus on a test that will be the
closest to what you are expected to do on a daily basis at this position. If you can pass this test
then you can feel confident that you can do the job we are asking you to do and you can also
understand better our work.

We are going to build a simple RESTful python api application. The application will need to be
built from scratch using the required following libraries (you may use other libs on top of these if
needed).

* FastAPI: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com
* Sqlalchemy: https://www.sqlalchemy.org/
* Pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/

Our sample application will be around vehicles since that’s our business. In the U.S., vehicles
have a universal id called the vehicle identification number (VIN) which is 17 characters long.
Besides the VIN we have standard year, make, model and trim to also better understand the car
along with many other possible attributes like color, engine, seats and more.
Vehicles are usually sold at dealers (at least for this app we will keep it simple) which have a
location and possibly other info like email, phone and website.

Let’s build a sample API application with the following requirements:

* Ability to create, update and delete vehicles with their relevant information
* Ability to create, update and delete dealers with their relevant information
* Vehicles should be associated with a dealer
* There should be a way to get all vehicles at a dealer

Things to consider to pass this test:
* Working App: There should be clear instructions on how to run the app and all routes
should work as expected
* Code Quality: Make sure you code is properly formatted and adheres to Python
standard coding practices
* Tests: A test suite should be available and all tests should be passing

How to submit your work: After you are finished, please zip up your entire application and
submit to your recruiter.
